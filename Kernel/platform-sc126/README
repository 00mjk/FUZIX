Initial 'it compiles' test prototype.


This is Fuzix for the SC126 Z180 RC2014 system with a suitable linear RAM/ROM
module (RAM is expected to fill the upper 512K) booting from ROMWBW

Based upon the N8VEM Mark IV port by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Cards required:
SC126 SBC

Not yet supported but planned:
 - RC2014 serial/ctc interfaces (only the onboard ports are handled)
 - RC2014 RTC
 - RC2014 TMS9918A
 - RC2014 CF adapter
 - Swap

To set up
Write fuzix.romwbw to blocks 2+
Partition with a vaguely modern fdisk (2048 block offset base, not 63)
Add partition for filesystem
Copy filesystem onto partition

The root filesystem device can be specified as either a decimal number, or as a
a device name (without the /dev prefix); hda, hdb, hda1, hda2, etc.

TODO:
- Identify SC111 v SC126 so we can merge the ports
- Move RTC to 0x0C
- On SC126
	- drive 0x0D 8 LED port
	- bitbang I2C port
	- 0x0C is
		7: RTC d out | I2C SDA
		6: RTC sclk
		5: /RTC_WE
		4: /RTC_CE
		3: /SD_CS2 	(really SPI CS2)
		2: /SD_CS1	(and SPI CS1)
		1: Flash selection (if not set by user)
		0: I2C SCL

	So 0x0C high 4 bits are the same as the classic DS1302 but we need
	a register tracking bits at all time.

- We should also support Black Adder and Tom's Z180 (and probably any other
  generic Z180 / linear 512/512 / CF )
