Dragon (32 or 64) + external memory cartridge

This port is for running FUZIX on real Dragons using an external
memory cartridge which is being prototyped.

The cartridge can have from 2 to 256 banks of 32KB each. It will
map the active bank at 0x8000-0xFEFF and use the EXMEM (SLENB) signal to
hide the internal ROMs. Writing the bank number to FFBF selects the
bank and activates the cartridge. Writing to FFBE deactivates the
cartridge. It is only active if the SAM is in map type 0.

The port reserves the internal RAM at 0-0x7FFF plus bank 0 for the kernel.

The port can use DriveWire to mount a root filesystem, and is
able to execute init. syscalls and fork have not been tested.
Swapping out to disk does not work yet.

There is not much 6809 userspace work done.
