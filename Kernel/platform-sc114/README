Experimental port for the SC114 mainboard plus CF card plus RTC card. This
port tries to use the SCM ROM as far as possible and also is intended to
support the SC108 via the same port. It's probably possible to add SC101 if
anyone wanted to.

The other SCM systems are different
- RC2014 has its own port and normally runs ROMWBW with 512K RAM/ROM
- The RC2014 64K RAM / 32K ROM system has a custom port and can't use the SCM
  as it needs the ROM for the OS kernel core
- Linc has a single 16K banked window and would need to spectrum 128K like port
  as well as banked kernel
- Tom's SBC has no banked RAM so would need a custom port with the kernel in
  ROM like the small RC2014 build

This is a design that happens to have 128K RAM but the 64K banks are flipped
directly. Fortunately there is a ROM which lives in both banks.

For the moment we stick the OS in RAM (it would be entertaining to explore
putting the kernel in ROM but as it's not trivially reprogrammable flash
lets leave that for a while). The SCM ROM must have the new API's

0x2A:
	DE = address in secondary bank to read

	returns value in A.

0x2B:
	A = byte to write to secondary bank
	DE = address in secondary bank to write


Memory map

Kernel

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	Kernel (common above 0x8000 for ROM dodging)
F000-F1FF	UDATA
F200-FCFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)
FD00-FFFF	ROM monitor owned

User

0000-00FF	Vectors (present in both banks)
0100-EFFF	User space
F000-F1FF	Kernel stack alternative (used during some bank switch ops)
F200-F2FF	Istack alternate (we may take interrupts in either bank)
F300-FCFF	Common (mostly valid in both banks)
FD00-FFFF	ROM monitor owned


TO DO

Write a proper bootloader that can use partition tables properly
Use the extra space to put back some kernel bits we binned from -tiny
Build a suitably high CP/M emuation and test it
CTC support and CTC no-rtc support
PPIDE ?
Finish SC108 compatibility



Long term fun
- OS core in ROM, high memory holding rest (like -tiny) but with two user space
banks ??
- Clean up the serial code (on all RC2014)


Boot Loader

The standard loader in the ROM is the CP/M loader. It loads 24 sectors (12K)
from sector 0 moves them to the top 12K of RAM and jumps to the address held
in 0xFFFE/FFFF

We subvert this loader and our own loader lives with a standard PC style
partition table and boots our OS. We ought to replace this with a nice loader
that can load CP/M from a partition as well as Fuzix from a file system.
