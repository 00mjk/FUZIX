An UZI target for the Amstrad PCW series computers

16K banked memory with flexible bank setting. Programs for now (until brk()
is done right) get 64K in four consecutive page numbers. The UAREA is mapped
high at 0xF900 with the process and irq stacks following and a copy of the
common area beyond (so we have a sort of common code area as needed)

The very top of memory must be free as the top of bank 3 (top of OS kernel
mapping) is "magically" the keyboard mappings.

Need to try and keep kernel under 48K or so to make it easier to handle the
screen memory, fonts etc. We need to put the screen (720x256 pixels + roller
ram table of 512 bytes or so = ~ 24K) in the low 128K
