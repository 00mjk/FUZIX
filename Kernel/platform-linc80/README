LiNC80 Experimental Port

This port supports the following configurations

	LiNC80 with at least one extra 16K bank of RAM as bank 1
	(additional banks will not be used at this point)

	IDE CF card configured with CP/M to load Fuzix (pending a better
	loader). Partition table 65536 blocks into the media with at
	least a root and swap partition present.

	Options:
		No LiNC80 or RC2014 add in cards are currently supported

	Planned:
		A different build that supports multiple banks of 16K or
		with a simple board mod 32K banks
		Maybe sound card when we get to the Fuzix sound support

TO DO

Write a proper bootloader that can use partition tables but will trick the
CPM loader into doing the right thing.

Version that supports multiple 16K banks and multiple processes in memory
ZX style. Also code to probe for and use the 32K hack which is far nicer.

Use IM2 properly and do serial buffering code
