TRS80 Model 4/4P

Requirements: 
	128K RAM fitted
	Hard disk drive (will be used for swap), or a suitable memory
	expander board could be used with a bit of tweaking (or both!)

Bank mapping on the trash 80 is a bit weird. We want to get two independent
64K banks, but we can only have

Port 0x84:
	

	0 / 1
	0 / 2
	0 / 3
	2 / 1
	3 / 1

So we put the kernel in 0/3 which allows us to put the apps in 2/1. This
means we need our kernel logic for things like bank copies not in common
but in the low 32K.


Unfortunately for anyone who wants to do expander board hacks the usual
expander board hacks exchange 2/3 with other banks so unless you've also got
the HD64180 mod you may be out of luck, and if you have well its not much
like a Trash80 any more. Anyway if you want try you'd need to extend the
0x84 port poking to also poke port 0x94 bits 0-4.

Also we have to deal with the mapping maze on the TRS 80, not only are we
banked but we have modes and also a pop up boot rom

0x9C bit 0 controls the boot prom

0x80 controls the mapping mode (bits 0/1 select a mode)

Boot occurs in mode 0 with RAM at 0x4000-FFFF ready to load

We need to stick it into mode 2 or 3

2 = 0000-F3FF RAM
    F400-F7FF keyboard
    F800-FFFF Video

3 = 0-FFFF RAM

(and probably want to be in mode 3 and flip to 2 for video/kbd work)

Need vid and kbd helps out of common therefore and to save/restore video map
option on an irq while in kernel mode
