uBee draft code


uBee disk formats

These are stored by the emulator

	track / head / sector

	some tracks are differently biased in some cases (sector ids range
	is weird)

DS40
	side 0 track 0, side 1 track 0, side 0 track 1....
SS80
	side 0 track 0, track 1, track 2 ...
DS80
	side 0 track 0, side 1 track 0, side 0 track 1....

HD3	490 cyl 4 heads 32 sectors/track 512bytes/sec


IMG or NW (nanowasp) 40 track
DS40
	40 track, 2 head, 10 sectors per track 512 bytes per sector
	double desnity 250Kbits/sec sector ids start at 1

SS80:
	80 tracks, 1 head, 10 sectors per track 512 bytes per sector
	sector offset is 1
DS80:
	as above but system sectors range 1-10 and data uses 21-30
	(tracks 2+ of each head)

DS82/4: like DS80 but sane sector ids


SS80 seems to be the normal boot format

Skew: 2 5 8 1 4 7 10 3 6 9 (usually done by OS)


CP/M seems to load as

Track 0 Side 0 1-10, Side 1 1-9 (no skew)

then switches to CP/M itself which is doing soft skews
