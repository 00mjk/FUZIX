Initial testing build for Tiny68K

You need a disk image with the boot loader on LBA 1 and the kernel on LBA 2+
Block 0 should hold a partition table and you must have a swap partition (type
7F).

To get us going and also debug some userspace problems along the way (32 bit
cleanliness, alignment) we are pretending to be a tiny system with only
enough RAM for one process at a time. It'll do to get us up and going.

Unsupported right now:
- RTC
- Detect if monitor is loaded high and if so avoid it
- Trapping back into monitor if high
- Reboot

Known problems
--------------

Traps need to report their actual trap number and the correct type and
frame (optionally for userspace)
Trap need to report extra frame info (eg address of bus error)

Signals need to include trap frame on stack and unwind it or siginfo ptr
or somesuch ?

Core dumps are unfinished (need to include trap frame info and a lot
more)

Something null pointers at boot time (sh)
	- sh nul pointers on ">/var/run/utmp"

Select doesn't work (need new hash algorithm for bigger setups)

(CURSES lib) invaders always reports that the terminal is too small
(stty reports rows cols correctly)

All I/O going via buffers
shutdown doesn't

Sometimes get a trap then it repeats
(various panics - trap then nready panic, switch fail etc)

Is the header and binary start mismatch right (seems to be 0x48 v 0x44)


chmem does not support 68K
cpuinfo does not support 68K


Should sh report (core dumped)?

To Do
-----

DONE Add a 'user touches kernel' catcher on the debug/sim
DONE ps user/kernel include mismatch error
DONE (libc bug) calendar does not put a : before 'cannot open file'
DONE fsh editing does not seem to work (build bug ?)
DONE (longjmp bug) sh exit command touches blows up
DONE levee just exits (bug in execve) now correctly says too big
DONE startrek pauses before hit any key to accept message
DONE (sh longjmp bug) init forgets to run the bootwait stuff
