Initial testing build for Tiny68K

You need a disk image with the boot loader on LBA 1 and the kernel on LBA 2+
Block 0 should hold a partition table and you must have a swap partition (type
7F).

To get us going and also debug some userspace problems along the way (32 bit
cleanliness, alignment) we are pretending to be a tiny system with only
enough RAM for one process at a time. It'll do to get us up and going.

Unsupported right now:
- RTC
- Detect if monitor is loaded high and if so avoid it
- Trapping back into monitor if high
- Reboot

Known problems
--------------

Traps need to report their actual trap number and the correct type and
frame (optionally for userspace)
Trap need to report extra frame info (eg address of bus error)

Core dumps are unfinished (need to include trap frame info and a lot
more)

fsh appears to silently die

All I/O going via buffers
ps user/kernel include mismatch error
init forgets to run the bootwait stuff (or something else goes pop)
shutdown doesn't
levee just exits

calendar does not put a : before 'cannot open file'

chmem does not support 68K
cpuinfo does not support 68K

Some app instability even causes a crash (0000A5DE_switchin: FAIL)


To Do
-----
Add a 'user touches kernel' catcher on the debug/sim
