Use a modern cc65 from https://github.com/cc65/cc65

Prototyping for 'large model' kernels for bigger memory maps. This set up uses
a split I/D arrangement for the kernel with bank 0 holding kernel DP/S IRQ S
and IRQ DP plus the I/O window and vectors. Bank 1 holds kernel code which with
the room available can be built optimized better. Bank 2 holds the kernel data
including 32K of buffer cache and the other buffers tuned to match the 2BSD
Unix recommendations for a 16 user system.


Our memory mapping looks like this

Bank 0:
	0x0000		Kernel DP
	0x0100		Kernel Stack (CPU)
	0x0200		IRQ stack
	0x0400		First user DP/Stack
	0xFE00		I/O Window
	0xFF00		Vectors and IRQ DP

Bank 1:
	...		Kernel image

Bank 2:
	...		Kernel data and C stacks


Bank 3+

And in user space

	0x0000		Unused
	0x00FE		syscall vector
	0x0100		Program (CPU stack is in bank 0)
	0xFC00		Udata copy (512 bytes)
	0xFE00		Spare
	0xFF00		Stubs [signal return etc]
			(keep in 0 page ?)

We don't yet allow for a split I/D user program using two banks and having 64K
code and 64K data. We also then need to track 'texts' as V7 does so that we
can share code segments when possible (often).

To build:
Set the platform/target
make clean
make


TODO
----
- Fix task switching: on big model our udata is in bank 2 and our kstack
  ring 0 so we can't save them as single 512 byte xfer but as we know we
  won't be using nearly all the 512 bytes of C stack we can save udata and
  most of C stack just fine.
- See 65c816 port for general notes
- Save jmpvec+1/2 in seg 2 on IRQ entry and restore on exit

Optimisations We Need To Do
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Only copy the needed memory when forking, not 64K ?
