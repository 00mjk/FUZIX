The MTX512 has the following relevant features

- "FDX" WD1791 floppy (and an actual DMA controller) at 0x40
  SASI interface for floppies
  (Not in emulator)
- "SDX" WD1791 style floppy (and no DMA controller) at 0x10
- 9918/29 VDP graphics (equivalent to MSX1 but on ports 1/2) - interrupts
  are fed to the CTC however
- Separate 80 column card (text mode only) (6845 on port 0x38/39)
  this has its own memory port poked via port 30,31 (set 31 
  bits 2-0 to the high address bits, bit 5 for attr, 6 for ascii, 7 for write
  then port 30 for the low bits. Port 32 is the data port (read after write
  before), port 33 for read/write is the attribute byte
- "silicon disc" (aka RAM discs) on 0x50-53 54-57 58-5b 5c-5f
- CTC timer (at CPU speed so can support single step)
- RS232 (Z80 DART)
- Sound (SN76489A) on I/O port 6, (strobe on port 3, 32uS reqired post
  strobe)

Memory is split into four banks the decode for which is dependent upon
whether the box is in "ROM based" or "RAM based" mode. The memory is then
switched in 48K banks with a 16K true common.

All memory management is controlled by the page port (port 0). Bit 7 is set
to 1 to turn the ROMs off, bit 4-6 detemine the rom page address, bits 0-3
select the RAM bank.

Note that Rememorizer is different, it allows 0x0f to be written to the
low 3 bits of port 0, then port 0xd2, d0, d1 control the 3 16K banks and also
has an SD card. Not supported, if you want it supported fix MEMU ;-)



On the MEMU emulator you can do a fast load for testing as follows

./fullcpm.sh -iobyte 0x80 -addr 0x0100 -mem /tmp/fuzix.com -addr 0x0100
-serial2-out /dev/tty -diag-console -sdx-mfloppy mfloppy/ref.fs -sdx-tracks
-40

(and add -diag-whatever as needed)

This flips the box into pure RAM mode, loads the image at 0x100 and runs it
fro there with the root floppy as mfloppy/ref.fs which needs to be a
suitable image. I'm currently using a 40 track image, but 80 should work
fine too (40 in 80 won't yet). It's quicker than booting CP/M and loading
the image.
