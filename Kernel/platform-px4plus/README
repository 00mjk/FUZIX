A FUZIX target for the PX4plus

Just playing to see if we can make it fit.

The PX4Plus has 64K of RAM, and can overlay 6000-DFFF with one of two
different ROMpacks (usually 'basic' and 'utility'). We build the kernel
at 0x6000 but for now plonk it into RAM so we can debug it. The small 8K
top window is awkward as we need to get udata and our kernel data/common in
that space if possible. We can hide the font/video below that under the top of
the ROM however.


Intended Memory Map


0x0000-0x00FF		Vectors
0x0100-0x???? (RAM)	User program (and discard area)
0xD000-0xDFFF		Framebuffer, font, video code
0xE000-0xF7FFish	Data for kernel
0xF800-0xFCFF		Common (currently ends FBCC)
0xFD00-0xFFFF		Udata

In kernel execution modes we then are either

0x0000-0x00FF		Vectors
0x0100-0x5FFF		Lower part of user
0x6000-0xDFFF		Kernel code in ROM
0xE000-0xF7FFish	Data for kernel
0xF800-0xFCFF		Common (currently ends FBCC)
0xFD00-0xFFFF		Udata

and we will need to tuck the video code/font/framebuffer at 0xD000 or
similar in RAM under the ROM area. May need to hide the floppy driver
there too as its all a little bit tight
