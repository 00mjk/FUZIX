Initial testing build for rc2014-68008

You need a disk image with the boot loader on LBA 0 and the kernel on LBA 1+
Block 0 should hold a partition table as well.

At the moment a 16x50 is expected at 0xC0 and is just driven as the ROM left
it.

At this point the tree compiles and you can boot it with the current ROM to
early spots in the kernel. However the Fuzix 68K code assumes writable vectors
but the board has ROM in the low 512K. The next stage is to update the ROM
to support revectoring the exceptions and interrupts that Fuzix needs.
