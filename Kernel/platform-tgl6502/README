Initial 6502 experimentation for the tgl6502 - as an experimental target
to play with 6502isms easily

Our memory mapping looks like this

	0x0000		ZP
	0x0100		6502 Stack (per proc) 
	0x0200		C stack (per proc)
	0x0400		I stack (per proc)
	0x0500		UData per proc
	0x0600+		Common copy

	0x2000		Kernel data	(8K)
	0x4000		Kernel data	(48K)

This ensures we can do all our stack flips in one operation when we switch
process in switchin.




Lots not yet done:

tricks.s is basically stubs for the 6502 code
signal checks are not being done on the syscall path (or irq path)

We hackishly chop up and share the 6502 256 byte system stack. Probably we
should just check for overflows and kill, or perhaps copy stacks in/out if
it would otherwise run out ?


Memory set up for now is banking, because we'll need swap and bank16k+swap
still needs significant work on the I/O side of things.
