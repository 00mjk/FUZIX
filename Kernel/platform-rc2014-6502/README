Initial sketches for a 6502 RC2014 banked memory platform

Use a modern cc65 from https://github.com/cc65/cc65

Our memory mapping looks like this

	0x0000-0x00FF	ZP
	0x0100-0x01FF	6502 Stack (per proc)
	0x0200-0x03FF	Loader (need to reclaim this FIXME)
	0x0400-0x3FFF	Common copy and whatever code fills the rest

	0x4000-0xBFFF	Kernel code
	0xC100-0xFFFF	Kernel common and vectors

In user space

	0x0000-0x3FFF	Kernel common and work area
	0x4000-0xFFF9	User space
	0xFFFA-0xFFFF	Vectors

We operate roughly like a 16K x 4 paged setup except that for now for simplicity
we treat user space as a fixed 48K bank switch. The other difference is that
being a 6502 we need it the other way up.

We currently stuff the low space with kernel code limiting process size to
0xC000 bytes. In theory we can trim that down and tidy up the maps a bit to
make user bigger. That can wait however.

Interrupts deal wth the shared ZP by swapping the ZP back and forth with the
interrupt copies (about 20 bytes involved)

Hardware Arrangement

6502 CPU
C000-C0FF hardwired as an I/O window that generates Z80 I/O cycles 0-FF on the
RC2014 bus
RAM connected via the RC2014 bus but with A15 inverted
512K RAM/ROM
16550A UART

Note: Because A15 is inverted the RAM/ROM 16K pages are mapped via

$C07A
$C07B
$C078
$C079

not the expected order


Challenges:

C000-C0FF are the I/O window, rather than somewhere sane like FExx

Next Steps

Generate the binary with the correct hole at C000-C0FF
Test and get initial boot working
Rebuild user space for 0x4000 start (need relocatable userspace yet)
Figure out how to reclaim 0200-03FF with commondata start
	(need to work out how loader knows where to jump...)
Write pre-emption code
Debug signal handling
Discard segment
Do buffer growth into discard
Swap support
Timer interrupt (TMS9918A or 6522VIA ?)

Look at other RC2014 device support
