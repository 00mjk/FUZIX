Basic support for a 6502 RC2014 banked memory platform

Use a modern cc65 from https://github.com/cc65/cc65

Our memory mapping hasn't been reworked from the C000 top of space so
still looks like this

	0x0000-0x00FF	ZP
	0x0100-0x01FF	6502 Stack (per proc)
	0x0200-0x03FF	Loader (need to reclaim this FIXME)
	0x0400-0x1FFF	Common data and whatever code fills the rest

	0x4000-0xBFFF	Kernel code
	0xC000-0xC0FF	I/O Window
	0xC000-0xFDFF	Kernel code/common/data/vectors
	0xFE00-0xFEFF	I/O Window
	0xFF00-0xFFF9	Not yet used (FIXME)
	0xFFFA-0xFFFF	Vectors

Everything we need to copy to/from userspace lives above C000

In user space

	0x0000-0x1FFF	Kernel common and work area
	0x2000-0xBFFF	User space
	0xC000-0xC0FF	Unused
	0xC100-0xFDFF	Kernel code/common/data/vectors
	0xFE00-0xFEFF	I/O Window
	0xFFFA-0xFFFF	Vectors

We operate roughly like a 16K x 4 paged setup except that for now for simplicity
we treat user space as a fixed 48K bank switch. The other difference is that
being a 6502 we need it the other way up.

We currently stuff the low space with kernel code limiting process size to
0xC000 bytes. In theory we can trim that down and tidy up the maps a bit to
make user bigger. That can wait however.

Interrupts deal wth the shared ZP by swapping the ZP back and forth with the
interrupt copies (about 20 bytes involved)

Hardware Arrangement

6502 CPU
FE00-FEFF hardwired as an I/O window that generates Z80 I/O cycles 0-FF on the
RC2014 bus
512K RAM/ROM
16550A UART

Challenges:

Next Steps

DONE	Generate the binary with the correct hole at C000-C0FF
DONE	Test and get initial boot working
DONE	Rebuild user space for 0x2000 start
	(need relocatable userspace yet)
DONE	Figure out how to reclaim 0200-03FF with commondata start
	(need to work out how loader knows where to jump...)
DONE	Discard segment
DONE	Write pre-emption code
DONE	Timer interrupt (6522VIA)
DONE	Debug signal handling

DONE	New PCB design with the IO hole at FExx
DONE	IDE card changes to qualify /R and /W with E to try and fix the IDE
		hardware glitching

IP	Real hardware testing


Do buffer growth into discard
Swap support
Move entry point etc

Look at other RC2014 device support
