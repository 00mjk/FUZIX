RC2014 8085

Initial support for the 8085 CPU + 16550A UART card + 512/512 RAM/ROM setup
using RC2014

Supported Hardware

	Ancient computing RC2014 8085 CPU card with interrupt fix

	512K ROM / RAM board. This board is basically a clone of the memory
	management system of the Zeta V2. Load it with the RC2014/85 BIOS.

	A 16Cx50 based serial adapter at 0xC0

	A clock source. Either the 82C54 card at 0x3C or a TMS9918A with
	interrupt enabled at 0x98/0x99. If you are using the rev3 or earlier
	board not the erratum and use a diode not a jumper for the IRQ

	RC2014 CF card interface at 0x10

Options

	None yet

To Enable

	ACIA at 0xA0
	DS1302 at 0x0C
	Joystick at 0x01/0x02
	More serial ports
	TMS9918A as console maybe ? (what to do for keyboard ?)

Unsupported
	Z80 support chip based devices (SIO, CTC, PIO, DMA)
	Hardware that uses the full 16bit I/O address space


RC2015 8085 Addresses for I/O

At this point:

0x0C		DS1302
0x10-0x17	IDE CF (ghosts 0x90-0x97)
0x3C-0x3F	82C54
0x70-0x7F	RAM/ROM card banking control
0x98-0x99	TMS9918A
0xA0-0xA7	ACIA (to add)
0xC0-0xC7	16550A UART

The bootloader from the ROM package goes on block 0 (with partition table),
the kernel goes on blocks 2+ with the file system and PC partition tables
as normal.



Unsolved
- Why does the 512K/512K card flake out with an 8085 running at the full 8MHz
