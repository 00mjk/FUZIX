Fuzix for the Z80 Membership Card

Supported Hardware

Full membership card stack. The front panel is required for the timer, and
the memory/SD card is required for memory and I/O.

Unsupported

Bit bang serial, LED display, front panel keypad

Implementation

This is a fairly classic machine with 32K fixed upper memory and 512K of
switchable lower memory that can replace the initial ROM in this area. The
upper RAM is not a bank of the lower RAM space.

Memory Layout

Kernel
0000-00FF	Interrupt vectors
0100-7FFF	Kernel code only
8000-F4FF	Kernel code and data
F500-FFFF	Kernel common

User
0000-00FF	Interrupt vectors
0100-7DFF	User space
7E00-7FFF	Per process kernel data copy
8000-BFFF	Kernel code and data
C000-FFFF	kernel common

Oddities

The timer runs at 1KHz so has to be handled specially.
