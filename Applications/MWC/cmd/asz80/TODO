Add outraw outrab and use them so that we can generate relocations

Change the output format to some kind of binary folow

Header
Code
Data
BSS
Symbols
DebugSymbols (optional copy of local only symbols)

Code/Data is packed as follows (BSS is 0 anyway but you can have a sym in
BSS)

0	END
1-223	copy this many bytes

224-239 reserved
241	relocate next byte low
242	relocate next byte high
243	relocate next word (native order)
	followed by symnum.w
	followed by data byte/word

Special symnums for versus our own base (for simple relocs) or a different
byte code (eg 240-247 / 248-255 where latter don't give sym ?)

Future

244	relocate ZP ref (6502)
245	24bit
246	32bit

etc

Symbol Table
type.b seg.b {addr} sym\0

type

bits 0-2 -> size of addr	1-4
bits 3-6 -> free
bit 7
	0x00	import
	0x80	export


Write a matching nlist(3) and nm to test the basics
