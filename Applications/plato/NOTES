Implement

- Fix up our output code to buffer into a 256 byte buffer
- Keep shovelling every tick
- Set the tty up and atexit properly
- Block all the signals we don't want (inc PIPE)
- Actually look up the address properly
- Get the splash screen off disk instead


It would be nice to squash it to the point we can afford 576 byte I/O buffers
