- Write some copt rules to stop the output sucking so much
- Steal the rst tricks done by BDS C
- Output mixed code/data so we can flush the literal pool every line of asm
  and maybe even get rid of the literal pool (2.5K saving)
- Can we split the preprocessor optionally
- Work out what is needed for stack frame based Z80 code
